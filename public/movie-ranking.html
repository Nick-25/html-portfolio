<h1>The Best Moves According to Nick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>
  This is currently my favorite movie.
</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Based on a Steven King novel. I thought it was really good! Favorite Quote: “I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living, or get busy dying.”</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>Realistic World War II portrayal, especially the intense D-Day scenes.</p>
